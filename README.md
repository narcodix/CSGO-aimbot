Aimbot for CSGO, based on the YOLOv8 machine learning model.

As far as I have seen, it is the first Aimbot to use YOLOv8. My goal is to speed up the recognition compared to the YOLOv5 based Aimbots that can already be found on GitHub.
But don't expect miracles, in the end it still depends on the available computing power.
It must be said, however, that a current mid-range GPU or better is required for an acceptable framerate (RTX3060 or better).

It will be released in the coming weeks.

IMPORTANT.
This is primarily a learning project.
