Aimbot for CSGO, based on the YOLOv8 machine learning model.

As far as I have seen, it is the first Aimbot to use YOLOv8. My goal is to speed up the recognition compared to the YOLOv5-based Aimbots that can already be found on GitHub, etc.

Since it's based on the YOLOv8s model, it can run on pretty much all modern GPUs since it doesn't require much vram. 

However, it must be said that for an acceptable framerate, a current mid-range GPU or better is mandatory (RTX3060 or better).

It will be released in the coming weeks.

IMPORTANT:
This is mainly a learning project.
